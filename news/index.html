        <p>Founder Discusses Game-Based History Learning On A Podcast</p>
        <h2>
          The founder of the project recently took part in an interview focused
          on the use of real-time strategy (RTS) games as educational tools for
          teaching history to children. During the interview, the founder
          explained how strategy games allow students to actively engage with
          historical concepts rather than simply memorizing dates and facts.
          Topics discussed included how managing resources, making strategic
          decisions, and responding to in-game events can help students better
          understand cause-and-effect relationships in historical contexts. The
          founder also highlighted how RTS gameplay encourages critical
          thinking, problem-solving, and collaboration, all while reinforcing
          key historical themes. The interview emphasized the project's goal of
          making history more interactive and accessible for younger audiences
          by combining curriculum-based learning with engaging gameplay
          experiences.

        <p>New Office Opens</p>
        <h2>
          We have officially opened a new educational development office to
          support the continued growth of the project. The office will serve as
          a collaborative space for designing and testing RTS-based history
          learning experiences aimed at younger students. This new location will
          be used for curriculum research, lesson planning, and the development
          of historically accurate game scenarios. It will also allow closer
          collaboration between game designers and educators to ensure that
          gameplay mechanics align with educational goals. The opening of the
          office marks an important step in expanding the project's ability to
          create engaging, interactive tools that help students explore history
          through strategy-based learning.
